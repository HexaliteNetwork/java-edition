## üíª Technologies

All of our Minecraft servers are built on top of the [Purpur][purpur] server software, proxied by [Velocity][velocity]. We also use [PostgreSQL][postgresql] as our database, and
use Redis for our multiserver caching and session system. We usually make a request to our rest webservers instead of directly accessing the database in multiple servers to avoid
unsynchronized or/and loss of data, and for communications we use [RabbitMQ][rabbitmq].

You can view a notice file of shaded libraries [here](shaded).

## üí∏ Supporting

### Starring the repository

If you do not want to help us with money, you can just star the repository, it still means a lot to us!

### Donations

You can support us by the GitHub sponsors program (**pending**) or on [OpenCollective][opencollective].


## üéâ Third party

We depend on many third party libraries and applications, a complete list can be found [here][third-party].


## üìú Licensing

To know about the license of this project, you can read the [LICENSE.md][license] file.


## ‚ú® Running locally

If you are interesting in contributing, please make sure to read our [contribution guide][contribution-guide] and join
our Discord community for further information and interaction with the developers and artists, and whoever knows what 
they are doing.

## UNIX-based systems

On UNIX-based systems the installation process is as follows:
1. Install the [Java Development Kit][jdk]. We recommend using the [IBM's Semeru][jdk-semeru] for the OpenJ9 virtual machine
and [Eclipse's Adoptium][jdk] for the Hotspot VM. We recommend installing both though.
2. Install the latest nightly build of [Rust][rust].
2. Install [Docker][docker] and [Docker Compose][docker-compose] for setting up the development environment in an easier way.
3. Install our command-line interface by running `./hexalite_cli.sh -s`, simple as that and it will be added to the PATH.
4. For composing the docker containers, you can run `hexalite -d`.
5. For preparing the server software and its configuration, you can run `hexalite -p`.
6. For building everything you'll need, you can run `hexalite -b`. For building and symlink the Minecraft plugins to 
their respective directories, you can run `hexalite -b name`, whereas `name` is one of the modules located at `arcade/`.
7. For starting the webserver, you can run `hexalite -w`. But it is worth mentioning that the rest webserver requires the
complete stack (PostgresQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) to be running though.
8. For running the Minecraft server, you can run `hexalite -m`. But it is worth mentioning that the rest webserver and
the complete stack (PostgresQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) are required to be running though.

## Windows 

The way this project is structured is by using mainly the symlinking technique, on Linux or any other UNIX-based system,
you can just use a bunch of scripts for the installation, but on Windows those are not available yet, so you may need to 
symlink manually or just move/copy the files.
